# excalidraw-sketches
The sketches I make with [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/).

I use [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) with the [excalidraw plugin](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) to create and manage my sketches.
You should be able to clone the repository and "Open folder as vault" in obsidian.

If any links to images are broken, you can hopefully find the image you need in the `img` folder.

I take no responsibility for the correctness of the sketches and many
of them may be out of date. If you notice some glaring mistakes, please
open an issue.
